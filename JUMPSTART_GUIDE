# Guide to Deploying BigQuery Jump Start Solution
## Overview
This document provides guidance on how to use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Jump Start Solutions to deploy a Data Warehouse with an integrated Looker Studio Dashboard automatically, as an alternative to manually creating datasets and dashboards.

### Step 1: Deploy Jump Start Solution
1. Open ten Jump Start Solutions Console
Method 1: Via Cloud Console

Open https://console.cloud.google.com
Click the ☰ menu (top-left corner)
Scroll down to Solutions → Jump Start Solutions

Deployment name: data-warehouse (This name will appear under Solution deployments)
Location: us-central1 or asia-southeast1
Project: profound-maker-477917-r0
Click "DEPLOY"
Wait approximately 5-10 minutes while the deployment progress bar completes
4. Verify Deployment Status
Navigate to Solutions → Solution deployments
Confirm that data-warehouse shows:
Status: Deployed (green checkmark)
Location: us-central1
Deployment date: deployment timestamp
Products: BigQuery, Looker Studio


### Step 2: Open Looker Studio Dashboard
1. Access Deployment Details
In Solution deployments, click "data-warehouse"
The Deployment details page will display:
OPEN BIGQUERY EDITOR
VIEW LOOKER STUDIO DASHBOARD
RESOURCES tab: Workflows, Cloud, and BigQuery resources
2. Open the Dashboard
Click"VIEW LOOKER STUDIO DASHBOARD"
The dashboard opens in a new Looker  Studio tab
The landing page is tiled "E-Commerce Business Pulse"
3. Explore the Dashboard

Inventory Costs: 2,395 (↓ 166.6%)
Profit: 1,868 (↑ 92.7%)
Line Chart: Revenue Year over Year (2019-2023)

Page 2: Distribution Center Efficiency
Shipping metrics
Return rates
Location analysis
Navigation:

Use the left-hand sidebar to switch between pages
Date filters are available at the top of the dashboard


### Step 3: Customising Dashboard
1. Create a Copy of the Dashboard
In Looker Studio, click "Edit and share"
If the dashboard is non-editable template, select "Make a copy"
Rename the dashboard to "COMM034 Retail Analytics – Revenue & Customer Insights"
2. Rename Dashboard and Add Subtitle
Click the dashboard title
Change the title to: COMM034 Retail Analytics – Revenue & Customer Insights
Add a subtitle: "Data from BigQuery Jump Start: thelook_ecommerce"
3. Add Custom Pages (from B3 Queries)
Page 3: Monthly Revenue by Category
Click "Add a page"
Page title: "Monthly Revenue"
Add a Data Source:
Resource → Add data → BigQuery → Custom Query
Paste SQL from B3.md Query 1:

SELECT

    FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%Y-%m', oi.created_at) AS month,

    p.category AS category,

    ROUND(SUM(oi.sale_price), 2) AS revenue

FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.order_items` oi

LEFT JOIN `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.products` p

    ON oi.product_id = p.id

WHERE oi.created_at >= '2024-01-01' AND oi.created_at < '2024-06-01'

GROUP BY month, category

ORDER BY month DESC, revenue DESC

LIMIT 20

Add Stacked Bar Chart:
Dimension: month
Breakdown Dimension: category
Metric: revenue
Page 4: Top 10 Customers
Add page → "Top Customers"
Custom Query (from B3.md Query 2):

SELECT

    oi.user_id,

    ROUND(SUM(oi.sale_price), 2) AS lifetime_spend

FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.order_items` oi

GROUP BY user_id

ORDER BY lifetime_spend DESC

LIMIT 10

Add a Table:
Columns: user_id, lifetime_spend
Add Scorecards:
Top Customer Spend: MAX(lifetime_spend)
Average: AVG(lifetime_spend)
Count: COUNT(user_id)
Page 5: Conversion Funnel
Add page → "Conversion Funnel"
Custom Query (from B3.md Query 3):

WITH views AS (

    SELECT FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%Y-%m', created_at) AS month, 

           COUNT(*) AS view_events

    FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.events`

    WHERE event_type = 'product'

      AND created_at >= '2024-01-01' AND created_at < '2024-06-01'

    GROUP BY month

), purchases AS (

    SELECT FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%Y-%m', created_at) AS month, 

           COUNT(*) AS purchase_events

    FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.events`

    WHERE event_type = 'purchase'

      AND created_at >= '2024-01-01' AND created_at < '2024-06-01'

    GROUP BY month

)

SELECT v.month,

       v.view_events,

       p.purchase_events,

       ROUND(SAFE_DIVIDE(p.purchase_events, v.view_events), 4) AS conversion_rate

FROM views v

LEFT JOIN purchases p USING (month)

ORDER BY v.month DESC

Add Combo Chart:
Dimension: month
Metric 1: view_events (Line)
Metric 2: purchase_events (Line)
Metric 3: conversion_rate (Bars)

Alternative Choice: Using a Custom Dataset (comm034_retail)
If comm034_retail is used instead of the Jump Start dataset:
1. Update the Looker Studio data Source
Resource → Manage added data sources
คลิกที่ data source → Edit
เปลี่ยน Custom Query:
From: bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.*
To: profound-maker-477917-r0.comm034_retail.*
Note: Remove WHERE filter, as comm034_retail contains fewer records.
2. SQL for comm034_retail
Refer to comments in B3.md, for example:

-- Custom dataset version:

-- FROM `profound-maker-477917-r0.comm034_retail.order_items` oi

-- LEFT JOIN `profound-maker-477917-r0.comm034_retail.products` p ...
